Digital Forensic &amp; Incident Response Related Tools:

“LiveResponse.bat” is a MS Windows batch script that consist of a series of commands that are helpful while doing live security incident response. The script uses many open source binaries to collect memory (64bit system only) and other useful forensic artifacts from the target system. In addition, the output from the script can be directed to any drive (i.e. "C:", "D:” etc.).

Due to licensing, the binaries are not shared - please review the content of the script to view varies binaries that are called. You will need to download those binaries, accept their respective EULAs and place them in the same folder as the script. 

The structure of the script is quick to understand and easy to customize. 

Script is shared with no guarantee - use at your own discretion.
